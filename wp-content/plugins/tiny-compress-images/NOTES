Note the following when making changes to the plugin:

1. XML-RPC

Wordpress can either be used via the web interface or through the official
Wordpress apps for mobile devices. Wordpress uses XML-RPC internally to
communicate between the app and the Wordpress admin. Make sure therefore
that when developing functionality that is linked to functionality available
in the mobile app that it also works over XML-RPC.
